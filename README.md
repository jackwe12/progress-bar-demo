4. Can't go under 0
5. Can go over limit, if value is over limit the bar itself and change its colour to red.
6. Display usage amount, centered
7. Write tests for code through TDD (JEST & Enzyme)
8. Implement a responsive solution for mobile, website and tablet.
9. Animate the bar change through scss.
10. Version control (git)
11. Using Eslint to improve code quality
12. Using SCSS for CSS preprocessor
13. Minification for JS & CSS
